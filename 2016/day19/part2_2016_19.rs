    // My first approach used a single VecDeque gift_circle and would remove the middle element
    // then rotate, repeating until one element is left. That works, but takes over 20 minutes on
    // my system (compiled with rustc -O).
    //
    // Because it always drops towards the midpoint, I had the idea to use 2 VecDeques, and instead
    // of rotating, pop the first element of one onto the end of the other. It took a lot of
    // thinking and trial-and-error to figure out the order to do things in, but the runtime is
    // down to only around 0.040 seconds on my system (also compiled with rustc -O).

    // setting the cutoff here sets it so that the first element of gift_circle_b is the first to
    // be dropped.

        // move the elf that just went to the back of the line.
        gift_circle_b.push_back(gift_circle_a.pop_front().unwrap());

        // this only runs every other time, which ensures that the bias towards the lower-value
        // elements is preserved.
        //
        // A side-effect of this approach means that gift_circle_b will always be at least as long
        // as gift_circle_a, so the last elf standing will be in gift_circle_b.
        if gift_circle_a.len() + 1 < gift_circle_b.len() {
