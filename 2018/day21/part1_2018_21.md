# 2018 Day 2 Part 1

I chose a bad time to pause working through older Advent of Code. Thankfully, I just ran through retracing my steps for 2018 day 19 part 2, as I'd accidentally deleted my inputs and wanted to make sure that all Rust solutions could compile with the 2024 edition, and the constant from the input is loaded in at compile time. Because of that recent practice, it's not as bad as it could be.

I decided that I'd start with some reverse engineering and analysis instead of attempting a brute-force solution.

## Take 1

### Stage 0 - convert to C and prepare tooling

I first copied over the reverse engineering tooling from 2018 day 19 part 2, and modified `convert-to-c.awk` to support bitwise operations.

I then further modified in a few ways, to make later parts of the process easier:

* absolute jumps and relative jumps with immediate offsets jump directly to the label, rather than using a fixed index within the label array
* The starting value of `r0` is passed as a parameter to the `elfcode` function.
* instead of changing `ban`, `bor`, `add`, and `mul` to the single-character C equivalents then using a regex to see if it was changed to run the common logic, I created a `basic_op` function which takes the character and does the common logic in place.
* instead of setting a temporary value in each branch of a conditional, then after the conditional, setting a final varaible to the temporary one, the final value is set directly.
* a "`NULLP`" constant is declared before the `elfcode` function, for use when labels in the array are known to be unused.
  * I could, of course, simply include `stdlib.h` and use `NULL`, but then it won't align with the 5-character `&&LNN` construct.
* the array of labels doesn't have its size explicitly specified, and is declared as `const`

I also modified `relabel.py` to support blank lines.

I then added a `.clangd` file, to enable `-Wall` and `-Wextra` warnings.

### Stage 1 - eliminate unneeded labels

Viewing the generated C code in an editor with LSP support, with `clangd` running, it immediately flaged one of the register variables as unused - namely, `r4`, which was bound to the instruction pointer. I removed that register variable.

After that, I started using the same approach I used in 2018 day 19 part 2, where I tried to iteratively remove more and more unused labels.

To do that, I run through the following steps repeatedly until no more changes are made:

1. find the lowest immediate offset used when accessing the label array, and replace any values within the array before that index with `NULLP`.
  * this is acceptable because registers have unsigned values, so it won't ever access an index less than the immediate offset.

2. Remove any labels marked by `clangd` as unused.

3. find a construct like `reg = boolean_cond;` followed by a `goto *l[N + reg];` without a label in between, and replace the `goto` with `if (reg) goto LN+1; else goto LN;`
 * because there's no way to jump in between them, this is equivalent

4. if the above substitution results in `else goto LN;` followed by `LN:` itself, remove the `else goto LN;`.

After the 4th run-through of those steps, the label array was entirely unused, so I removed it.

### Stage 2 - refactor into clearer structure

Stage 1 had left several instances of the following pattern:

```c
    /* ... */
    if (cond) goto LNN;
    goto LMM;
LNN:
    /* ... */
```

I replaced those with the following:


```c
    /* ... */
    if (!cond) goto LMM;
LNN:
    /* ... */
```

Then, if `LNN:` is marked as unused, I remove it.

Oddly, that resulted in the same pattern appearing again in a few cases, because of code like the following:

```c
    /* ... */
    if (cond) goto L02;
    goto L03;
L02:
    goto L04;
L03:
    /* ... */
```

which would become

```c
    /* ... */
    if (!cond) goto L03;
L02:
    goto L04;
L03:
    /* ... */
```


Then, after removing the unused `L02`, it would become

```c
    /* ... */
    if (cond) goto L04;
L03:
    /* ... */
```

The beginning of the code was the bizarre `bani`-based check described on the website. It only used one register, and that register is zeroed out right afterwards, so the check (i.e. the first 5 lines) could be removed.

One such removal resulted in `if (r3) goto L27;`, followed immediately by `r3 = 0;`, which means that the latter is only ever run if `r3` is already equal to zero, so I removed that line. *(I later regretted this)*.

Stage 2's code's ending also jumped out at me, because it's the only place the `r0` register is used. It checks if the `r2` register is equal to the `r0` register, and jumps back to the start if it is not, terminating otherwise.

```c
unsigned long long elfcode(unsigned long long r0) {
    unsigned long long r1 = 0, r2 = 0, r3 = 0, r5 = 0;
L05:
    /* ... */
    r3 = r2 == r0;
    if (!r3) goto L05;
    return r0;
}
```

At the end of stage 2, my code was as follows (with some constants redacted):

```c
unsigned long long elfcode(unsigned long long r0) {
    unsigned long long r1 = 0, r2 = 0, r3 = 0, r5 = 0;
L05:
    r5 = r2 | 65536;
    r2 = CONST_A;
L07:
    r3 = r5 & 255;
    r2 += r3;
    r2 &= 16777215;
    r2 *= CONST_B;
    r2 &= 16777215;
    r3 = 256 > r5;
    if (r3) goto L27;
L17:
    r1 = r3 + 1;
    r1 *= 256;
    r1 = r1 > r5;
    if (r1) goto L25;
    r3 += 1;
    goto L17;
L25:
    r5 = r3;
    goto L07;
L27:
    r3 = r2 == r0;
    if (!r3) goto L05;
    return r0;
}
```

### Stage 3 - untangling the spaghetti

For this stage, my goal was to replace labels and `goto` statements with semantically-equivalent but more structured control flow.

The first step was to relpace the starting `L05` and ending `if (!r3) goto L05;` with a `do ... while` loop.

Then, I rewrote the `L17` loop into a `while (1)` loop, and replaced the `goto L25` with `break`, which meant that the `L25` label was now unused, so I removed it.

The result of those changes was as follows:

```c
unsigned long long elfcode(unsigned long long r0) {
    unsigned long long r1 = 0, r2 = 0, r3 = 0, r5 = 0;
    do {
        r5 = r2 | 65536;
        r2 = CONST_A
        while (1) {
            r3 = r5 & 255;
            r2 += r3;
            r2 &= 16777215;
            r2 *= CONST_B;
            r2 &= 16777215;
            r3 = 256 > r5;
            if (r3) break;
            while (1) {
                r1 = r3 + 1;
                r1 *= 256;
                r1 = r1 > r5;
                if (r1) break;
                r3 += 1;
            }
            r5 = r3;
        }
        r3 = r2 == r0;
    } while (!r3);
    return r0;
}
```

Because `r1` is only ever used in the innermost loop, changing its value doesn't have any effects on any of the rest of program, and it can be removed entirely - the innermost loop can then become the following one-liner:

```c
while ((r3 + 1) * 256 <= r5) r3++;
```

Because of the `if (r3) break` right before the loop, `r3` will be zero at the start, so that loop always sets it to the largest multiple of 256 that's less than `r5`:

```c
if (r5 & 256) {
    r3 = (r5 & ~256ULL);
} else {
    r3 = r5 - 256;
}
```

This would have been more obvious had I not removed the code explicitly setting it to zero during stage 2.

```c
unsigned long long elfcode(unsigned long long r0) {
    unsigned long long r2 = 0, r3 = 0, r5 = 0;
    do {
        r5 = r2 | 65536;
        r2 = CONST_A;
        while (1) {
            r3 = r5 & 255;
            r2 += r3;
            r2 &= 16777215;
            r2 *= CONST_B;
            r2 &= 16777215;
            r3 = 256 > r5;
            if (r3) break;
            if (r5 & 255) {
                r3 = (r5 & ~255ULL);
            } else {
                r3 = r5 - 256;
            }
            r5 = r3;
        }
        r3 = r2 == r0;
    } while (!r3);
    return r0;
}
```

The next thing that caught my attention is what runs before the ~innermost loop~ r3-setting code.

```c
r3 = r5 & 255;
r2 += r3;
r2 &= 16777215;
r2 *= CONST_B;
r2 &= 16777215;
r3 = 256 > r5;
```

The first time `r3` is set, it's only used to add to `r2`, and it's overwritten at the end of that sequence, so that write can be removed:

```c
r2 += r5 & 255;
r2 &= 16777215;
r2 *= CONST_B;
r2 &= 16777215;
```

In fact, all uses of `r3` seem to be temporary values that are used one and ignored, so I reworked the code to remove it. It's used by the artist formerly known as the inner loop as a temporary value to set `r5`, and it's used as the terminating variable at the end of the function.

```c
unsigned long long elfcode(unsigned long long r0) {
    unsigned long long r2 = 0, r5 = 0;
    do {
        r5 = r2 | 65536;
        r2 = CONST_A;
        while (1) {
            r2 += r5 & 255;
            r2 &= 16777215;
            r2 *= CONST_B;
            r2 &= 16777215;
            if (r5 < 256) break;
            if (r5 & 255) {
                r5 &= ~255ULL;
            } else {
                r5 -= 256;
            }
        }
    } while (r2 != r0);
    return r0;
}
```

While it's still a bit too complex to easily figure out, it's clear from this that if `r0` is set the ending value of `r2` after one run-through, it will only run through once, and the body of the function can be rewritten to return `r2` at the end of the loop.

```c
unsigned long long answer(void) {
    unsigned long long r2 = 0, r5 = 0;
    r5 = r2 | 65536;
    r2 = CONST_A;
    while (1) {
        r2 += r5 & 255;
        r2 &= 16777215;
        r2 *= CONST_B;
        r2 &= 16777215;
        if (r5 < 256) break;
        if (r5 & 255) {
            r5 &= ~255ULL;
        } else {
            r5 -= 256;
        }
    }
    return r2;
}
```

And the answer is too low. Figures. Time to retrace my steps, and see if I made a mistake.

## Take 2

Starting again with the output of `driver.sh`, I tried the same approach again:

### Stage 1

The end result of stage 1 is identical - as in once all of the C files are formatted with `clang-format`, there's no difference.

### Stage 2

I took the same approach as last time, but I left the `r3 = 0;` line that I'd previously removed.

### Stage 3

This time, with the `r3 = 0;` intact, it was easier to replace the innermost loop with the following:

```c
for (r3 = 0; (r3 + 1) * 256 <= r5; r3++);
```

Now that I looked at it that way, it seemed an awful lot like integer division - in fact, that's exactly what it was, so the inner loop could be replaced with `r3 = r5 / 256;`, and because the next line is `r5 = r3`, and because `r3` is overwritten to before any other place it's used, it can be further rewritten as `r5 /= 256;`.

The new program is as follows:

```c
unsigned long long elfcode(unsigned long long r0) {
    unsigned long long r2 = 0, r3 = 0, r5 = 0;
    do {
        r5 = r2 | 65536;
        r2 = CONST_A;
        while (1) {
            r3 = r5 & 255;
            r2 += r3;
            r2 &= 16777215;
            r2 *= CONST_B;
            r2 &= 16777215;
            r3 = 256 > r5;
            if (r3) break;
            r5 /= 256;
        }
        r3 = r2 == r0;
    } while (!r3);
    return r0;
}
```

Removing `r3` as before:

```c
unsigned long long elfcode(unsigned long long r0) {
    unsigned long long r2 = 0, r5 = 0;
    do {
        r5 = r2 | 65536;
        r2 = CONST_A;
        while (1) {
            r2 += r5 & 255;
            r2 &= 16777215;
            r2 *= CONST_B;
            r2 &= 16777215;
            if (r5 < 256) break;
            r5 /= 256;
        }
    } while (r2 != r0);
    return r0;
}
```

The inner logic is looking suspiciously `for`-loop-like, so I further rewrote it:
```c
unsigned long long elfcode(unsigned long long r0) {
    unsigned long long r2 = 0, r5 = 0;
    do {
        r5 = r2 | 65536;
        for (r2 = CONST_A; r5 >= 256; r5 /= 256) {
            r2 += r5 & 255;
            r2 &= 16777215;
            r2 *= CONST_B;
            r2 &= 16777215;
        }
    } while (r2 != r0);
    return r0;
}
```

Still, replacing the body of the `answer` function was still too low. Darn it.

## Take 3

After taking some time away, and thinking it through, based on my previous analysis, I decided to just modify the execution function of my existing rust Elfcode interpreter with a special case in the instruction match:
```rust
fn get_target_val(code: &[Instruction], ip_binding: usize, input_val: usize) -> Option<usize> {
    let mut regs: Regs = [input_val, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
    while let Some(Instruction(opcode, args)) = code.get(regs[ip_binding]) {
        match opcode {
            /* ... */
            Opcode::Eqrr if regs[args.b] == 0 => return Some(regs[args.a]),
            Opcode::Eqrr => regs[args.c] = usize::from(regs[args.a] == regs[args.b]),
        }
        regs[ip_binding] += 1;
    }
    None
}
```

This got the right answer instantly.

# 2018 Day 21 Part 2

This time, I decided to first try the brute-force route.
