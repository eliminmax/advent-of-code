# My Advent of Code solutions

These are my solutions to Advent of Code - mostly written in 2024, but not just for 2024 - while working on Advent of Code 2024, I went through previous years as well - whenever I was caught up on 2024's solutions, I'd go from 2015 day N to 2016 day N through to 2023 day N, then 2015 day N + 1. Upon completing 2024's Advent of code, I decided to iterate through the years one by one rather than iterating through the days. As of January 2nd, 2025, I've completed both 2015 and 2016.

I started Advent of Code in 2023 in Rust, but only got 2 days in before I was caught up with other things, and I lost the solutions from those 2 days.

At the start of my efforts, I primarily used Python for my solutions, or occasionally AWK or Rust, but as I've worked my way through, I've found myself using Rust more and more, and occasionally using C as well. The one time that the problem involved filtering JSON data, I used jq, and when AWK seems to me to be the best tool for the job, I use it, but that's become rarer as I've gotten into more challenging tasks.

Every solution is a standalone source file, with dependencies only on its language's standard library and occasionally other source files in the same directory.
