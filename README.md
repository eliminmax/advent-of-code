# My Advent of Code solutions

I started Advent of Code in 2023, but only got 2 days in before I was caught up with other things.

For 2024, I'm trying to go through all years of 10 Advent of Code at once, using whatever langauges seem to be the best tools for the job based on my experience.

I typically use Python to solve the type of one-off number-crunching problem Advent of Code consists of, but sometimes, depending on the specific problem, I'll use AWK, or sometimes Rust.
