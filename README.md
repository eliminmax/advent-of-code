# My Advent of Code solutions

These are my solutions to Advent of Code - mostly written in 2024, but not just for 2024 - I'm going through previous years as well - assuming I'm caught up on 2024's solutions, I'll go from 2015 day N ot 2016 day N through to 2023 day N, then 2015 day N + 1.

I started Advent of Code in 2023 in Rust, but only got 2 days in before I was caught up with other things, and I lost the solutions from those 2 days.

At the start of my efforts, I primarily used Python for my solutions, or occasionally AWK or Rust, but as I've worked my way through, I've found myself using Rust more and more, and occasionally using C as well. When AWK seems to me to be the best tool for the job, I use it, but that's become rarer as I've gotten into more challenging tasks.
