# My Advent of Code solutions

I started Advent of Code in 2023 in Rust, but only got 2 days in before I was caught up with other things.

For 2024, I'm trying to go through multiple years of Advent of Code at once, using whatever languages seem to be the best tools for the job based on my experience.

At the start, I primarily used Python for my solutions, or occasionally AWK or Rust, but as I've worked my way through, I've found myself using Rust more and more, and occasionally using C as well. When AWK seems to me to be the best tool for the job, I use it, but that's become rarer over time.
